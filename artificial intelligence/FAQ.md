## Prompt engineering

<details>
  <summary><b>What is a prompt? What is prompt engineering?</b></summary>
  The prompt is a textual instruction used to interact with a Large Language Model. Prompt     engineering, on the other hand, is a set of methods and techniques for developing and optimizing prompts. prompt engineering is specifically designed to improve the capabilities of models for complex tasks that require reasoning (question answering, solving mathematical problems, and so on).


  Prompt engineering can have other functions such as improving LLM safety (instructions that serve to prevent the model from responding in a toxic manner) or providing additional knowledge to a model


  Prompt engineering can have other functions such as improving LLM safety (instructions that serve to prevent the model from responding in a toxic manner) or providing additional knowledge to a model


  A prompt, in its simplest form, is a set of instructions or a question. In addition, it might also contain other elements such as context, inputs, or examples.


  prompt:

  ```
  Which is the color of the sea?
  ```
output from a LLM:
  ```
  Blue
  ```

Formally, a prompt contains or more of these elements: 
* **Instruction**. Information about the task you want the LLM execute
* **Context**. Additional or external information the model has to take into account.
* **Input data**. Input data that can be processed
* **Output indicator**. We can provide additional requirements (type or format of the output)

  prompt:

  ```
    Classify the sentiment of this review as in the examples:

  The food is amazing - positive
  the chicken was too raw - negative
  the waitress was rude - negative
  the salad was too small -
  ```
