## Prompt engineering

<details open>
  <summary><b>What is a prompt? What is prompt engineering?</b></summary>
  The prompt is a textual instruction used to interact with a Large Language Model. Prompt     engineering, on the other hand, is a set of methods and techniques for developing and optimizing prompts. prompt engineering is specifically designed to improve the capabilities of models for complex tasks that require reasoning (question answering, solving mathematical problems and so on).

  Prompt engineering can have other functions such as improving LLM safety (instructions that serve to prevent the model from responding in a toxic manner) or providing additional knowledge to a model

  Prompt engineering can have other functions such as improving LLM safety (instructions that serve to prevent the model from responding in a toxic manner) or providing additional knowledge to a model

  A prompt, in its simplest form, is a set of instructions or a question. In addition, it might also contain other elements such as context, inputs, or examples.
