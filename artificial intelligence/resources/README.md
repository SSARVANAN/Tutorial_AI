In this section, I will suggest and add many resources related to artificial intelligence that can be useful. The list is not exhaustive and I will expand with time, if you want to suggest other resources, you are welcome.

I am listing seminal articles (the list is clearly not exhaustive), free available books, free courses and useful tools that I found. I am also listing a large set of database where you can find dataset for different machine learning tasks. These categories are also organized with sub-categories for clarity.

# Scientific articles

This is a list of seminal articles on different fields of artificial intelligence. This is list is not meant to be complete (but I will expand with time and you can suggest additions). I see a starting point of articles that should be read it, I consulted most of them for my tutorials and many of them present the basis of the artificial intelligence. I try to cover many field of the actual artificial intelligence research. I am listing free accessible articles that can be accessed by anyone.

## Tools for scientific article

Keep the pace with the number of articles published every year is impossible (it is difficult to identify the most important articles in the field or either to read all). These tools can help to identify important article, organize your library, explore similar articles and much more.

# Dataset database

Here a list of many dataset database/repository for many different fields of artificial intelligence. For a ML/AI task you need two things: data and algorithm. This list is meant to help you witht he first part of the question: the data. I am providing here a list of links to databases where you can find many available to datasets (check the dataset section in the repository where I provide single datasets).
