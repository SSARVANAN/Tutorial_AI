In this section, you will find the Jupiter Notebook for the the tutorial I published in Medium. I suggest to read the tutorial and the companion tutorial code in the order provided in the table below. For practical reason, I have divided some of the tutorial in more than one part (allowing to concentrate in one of the tutorial on the theoretical part and in the others about the programming). Tutorial dedicated only to the theory have not a linked Jupiter notebook.

Moreover, you may find here some colab notebook without a theoretical tutorial. I decided to upload the code before I have finish to write the theoretical part (this would be indicated). I am convinced that the code alone is already beneficial. I would successively publish on Medium the written article (with details and comment to the code).

You may write me for any request, suggestions and comments.
