In this section, you will find the Jupiter Notebook for the the tutorial I published in Medium. I suggest to read the tutorial and the companion tutorial in the order provided in the table below. For practical reason, I have divided some of the tutorial in more than one part (allowing to concentrate in one of the tutorial on the theretical part and in the others about the programming). Tutorial dedicated only to the theory have not a linked Jupiter notebook.
