In this section, you will find a collection of datasets for machine learning project. I am curating here a selection of datasets that you can use for different tasks and I am using in my tutorials. I am adding also some notebook where I show and explain in details the dataset (making easy to use them). Check the **Google Colab** notebook, I am presenting the dataset providing information (history, context, additional information) but also showing visualization techniques for exploratory data analysis. The idea is the a ML beginner (but also who is interested in data science) can find a selection of datasets appropriate for different tasks: Moreover, the notebook can help to have a quick view of the datasets, to gain data visualization idea. In addition, I am using these datasets in my tutorial on Machine learning and artificial intelligence, provided real case uses and explain in details algorithm.

I am storing here the datasets as CSV file, if bigger than 50 MB I uploading the zip file. Check below how to import in Colab a zip file.

I will add other datasets soon. You may write me for any request, suggestions and comments.

# Usage

To use the dataset in your project you can download them or if you use in colab:

for CSV file 

```Python
#example for a dataset
#you can read from directory or directly from url
data_dir = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/main/datasets/Boston.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(data_dir)
```

If the file is contained in a zip.file, to upload in Google Colab


```Python
import sys
import os
#this for unzip and read the file
!wget https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/datasets/IMDB.zip?raw=true
!unzip IMDB.zip?raw=true
imdb_data=pd.read_csv("IMDB Dataset.csv")
```
