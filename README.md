I decided to collect here a set of tutorials and complementary code about artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science. I have divided this repository in different sections (each one cover a different macro area of data science). You will find tutorial, code and also a list of resources related to the different topics (links to articles, free books, free courses, libraries and so on).

Here, you will find the Jupiter Notebook for the the tutorial I published in Medium. I suggest to read the tutorial and the companion tutorial code in the order provided in the table below. For practical reason, I have divided some of the tutorial in more than one part (allowing to concentrate in one of the tutorial on the theoretical part and in the others about the programming). Tutorial dedicated only to the theory have not a linked Jupiter notebook. 

Most of the code is written in Python, but you can find also some Excel file that I have created to make easier understand some of the concepts. I have also planned to add some script in R (since it is wide used by statistician, biologist and so on).

Moreover, you may find here some colab notebook without a theoretical tutorial (yet). I decided to upload the code before I have finish to write the theoretical part (this would be indicated). I am convinced that the code alone is already beneficial. I would successively publish on Medium the written article (with details and comment to the code).

You may write me for any request, suggestions and comments. If you find useful please follow and/or share (a star is always really appreciated).

# About me

I am Salvatore Raieli, Senior Data Scientist in a pharmaceutical company. My work consist in applying machine learning and artificial intelligence in drug discovery process. I have a PhD in immunology and I have years of experience in coding, machine learning and bioinformatics. I have worked in different projects related to machine learning and biology (for work or for passion). I am following a master in Artificial Intelligence to dive inside the theory. I have always been passionated about artificial intelligence, biology and understand how complex systems work.   

I think that artificial intelligence will drive the new wave of innovation and it will revolution biology, medicine and pharma industry. I always thought that science should be more democratic and sharing knowledge is fundamental for the improvement of science. For this reason, I have planned to write tutorials where trying to explain machine learning and artificial intelligence in the easiest way possible.

# Tutorials on machine learning

This series of tutorials is focused on classical machine learning (regression, classification, dimentional reduction and so on). I will discuss the basic, the math behind models and how to implement.

# Articles on artificial intelligence

In this series of tutorials, I will focus on artificial intelligence (neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and many other related topics). I will discuss the basics, the math behind models, and how to implement them. I will use Keras and PyTorch
