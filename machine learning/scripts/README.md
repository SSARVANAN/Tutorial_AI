This section is dedicated to scripts that can be used by the user. Here, there are different scripts dedicated to different topics. The scripts can be directly executed (the data are present in this repository). Provided, you have installed the required libraries the script can be executed on any computer. 

You may modify the script to execute with your data

For example, if you want to use my MAR script in your pc you can simply execute it in this way:

```Python
python3 MAR.py
```

Or alternatively:

```Python
python3.8 MAR.py
```


| File |  Description |
|----------- | ------ |
|[MAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
|[MNAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MNAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MNAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
|[MCAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MCAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MCAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
